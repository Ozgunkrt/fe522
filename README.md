# Bogazici University FE 522 R Lecture Notes (Fall 2016)

The course is given by Prof. Refik Güllü. I helped with the R application of the financial models part. These are not the full lecture notes, only the R application part. It may be helpful if you are interested in Monte Carlo Simulation, Option Pricing, Term Structure Models and related quantitative finance topics.
